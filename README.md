# Arabic Spelling Correction
Implementation of: Linear Spelling check, BK-Tree, and SymSpell spelling checking algorithms on Arabic dictionary, in C++

The code mainly implements:
* Levenshtein distance
* Linear Spell Checking
* BK-Tree Spel Checking
* SymSpell Spell Checking

### I 'll be back to:
* Add better documentation and how-to-use

### Possible improvements:
* Use static array (instead of vector) for suggested words -- with maximum number of suggested words
* Use static array of bytes instead of string.
